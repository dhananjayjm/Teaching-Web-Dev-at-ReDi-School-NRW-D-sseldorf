## Exploring the teaching role for Web Development at ReDi School, DÃ¼sseldorf!

From 2008 to 2019, I embarked on a fascinating journey as a lecturer in Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics across diverse academic levels in India. In addition to my teaching endeavors, I had the privilege of sharing the wonders of amateur astronomy as a demonstrator at ![IUCAA](https://www.iucaa.in/en/).
